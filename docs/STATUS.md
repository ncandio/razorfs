# RAZORFS Development Status

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-04
**Current Phase**: Phase 2 Complete ✅

## Overview

RAZORFS is a multithreaded FUSE filesystem with shared memory persistence, currently transitioning to production-ready status through a 6-phase roadmap.

---

## ✅ Completed Features

### Core Filesystem (Phase 0)
- ✅ **N-ary tree** with 16-way branching factor
- ✅ **Multithreading** with ext4-style per-inode reader-writer locks
- ✅ **Shared memory persistence** for data survival across mounts
- ✅ **String table** with hash table for O(1) string interning
- ✅ **Compression** with zlib (optional, threshold-based)
- ✅ **NUMA support** (optional, auto-detected)
- ✅ **Memory alignment** (128-byte aligned nodes for cache efficiency)

### Security & Correctness
- ✅ **Path traversal protection** (validates ".." and control characters)
- ✅ **Race condition fixes** in tree operations
- ✅ **Unsafe string handling** fixes (strncpy, bounds checking)
- ✅ **Memory leak** fixes in all components
- ✅ **Comprehensive test suite** (5 test categories, all passing)

### Phase 1: Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) ✅
**Status**: Complete - Ready for Integration
**Files**: `src/wal.h`, `src/wal.c`, `tests/unit/wal_test.cpp`

**Features**:
- Circular buffer with configurable size (default 8MB)
- Transaction support (begin, commit, abort)
- Operation logging (INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE, WRITE)
- Checkpointing for space reclamation
- CRC32 data integrity checking
- Concurrent transaction support
- Shared memory and heap modes
- 22 unit tests (all passing)

**Not Yet Integrated**: WAL is implemented but not hooked into filesystem operations. This allows testing and future integration without affecting current functionality.

### Phase 2: Crash Recovery ✅
**Status**: Complete - Ready for Integration
**Files**: `src/recovery.h`, `src/recovery.c`, `tests/unit/recovery_test.cpp`

**Features**:
- ARIES-style three-phase recovery (Analysis, Redo, Undo)
- Transaction table management
- Idempotent operation replay
- CRC32 checksum validation
- Committed transaction redo
- Uncommitted transaction rollback
- Clean shutdown detection
- Recovery statistics tracking
- 13 unit tests (all passing)

**Design Document**: See `docs/RECOVERY_DESIGN.md`

**Not Yet Integrated**: Recovery is implemented but not hooked into mount process. Integration will be done in future phase.

## 🚧 In Progress

### Phase 3: Extended Attributes (xattr)
**Status**: Not Started
**Design**: See `docs/XATTR_DESIGN.md` (to be created)
**Dependencies**: None

**Planned Features**:
- xattr storage design
- xattr pool implementation
- FUSE xattr operations (getxattr, setxattr, listxattr, removexattr)
- xattr persistence
- xattr tests

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### Current Limitations

- ⚠️ No crash recovery integration (implemented but not hooked into mount)
- ❌ No xattr support (Phase 3)
- ❌ No hardlink support (Phase 4)
- ❌ No mmap support (Phase 5)

### Resolved Issues

- ✅ Race conditions (fixed)
- ✅ Memory leaks (fixed)
- ✅ Memory alignment (fixed to 128-byte)
- ✅ String table performance (O(n) → O(1))
