# RAZORFS Development Status

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-04
**Current Phase**: Phase 1 Complete ✅

## Overview

RAZORFS is a multithreaded FUSE filesystem with shared memory persistence, currently transitioning to production-ready status through a 6-phase roadmap.

---

## ✅ Completed Features

### Core Filesystem (Phase 0)
- ✅ **N-ary tree** with 16-way branching factor
- ✅ **Multithreading** with ext4-style per-inode reader-writer locks
- ✅ **Shared memory persistence** for data survival across mounts
- ✅ **String table** with hash table for O(1) string interning
- ✅ **Compression** with zlib (optional, threshold-based)
- ✅ **NUMA support** (optional, auto-detected)
- ✅ **Memory alignment** (128-byte aligned nodes for cache efficiency)

### Security & Correctness
- ✅ **Path traversal protection** (validates ".." and control characters)
- ✅ **Race condition fixes** in tree operations
- ✅ **Unsafe string handling** fixes (strncpy, bounds checking)
- ✅ **Memory leak** fixes in all components
- ✅ **Comprehensive test suite** (5 test categories, all passing)

### Phase 1: Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) ✅
**Status**: Complete - Ready for Integration
**Files**: `src/wal.h`, `src/wal.c`, `tests/unit/wal_test.cpp`

**Features**:
- Circular buffer with configurable size (default 8MB)
- Transaction support (begin, commit, abort)
- Operation logging (INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE, WRITE)
- Checkpointing for space reclamation
- CRC32 data integrity checking
- Concurrent transaction support
- Shared memory and heap modes
- 22 unit tests (all passing)

**Not Yet Integrated**: WAL is implemented but not hooked into filesystem operations. This allows testing and future integration without affecting current functionality.

## 🚧 In Progress

### Phase 2: Crash Recovery
**Status**: Not Started
**Design**: See `docs/RECOVERY_DESIGN.md` (to be created)
**Dependencies**: WAL (Phase 1) ✅

**Planned Features**:
- Three-phase recovery (Analysis, Redo, Undo)
- Mount-time recovery
- Idempotent operations
- Corrupted log detection

---

## 🎯 Next Session Tasks

### Option A: Continue with Phase 2 (Recommended)
1. Create `docs/RECOVERY_DESIGN.md`
2. Implement recovery algorithm
3. Add recovery tests
4. Integrate with mount process

### Option B: Integrate WAL First
1. Add WAL to `razorfs_mt.c` (optional flag)
2. Wrap filesystem operations in transactions
3. Add integration tests
4. Performance benchmarks

### Option C: Jump to Phase 3
1. Skip recovery for now
2. Implement xattr support
3. Return to recovery later
