CACHE LOCALITY BENCHMARK RESULTS
================================

FILESYSTEMS COMPARED:
- razorfs (FUSE3): RazorFS mounted via FUSE3
- ext4: Standard Linux filesystem

BENCHMARK RESULTS:
- Directory Traversal:
  * razorfs (FUSE3): 0.235s
  * ext4: 0.192s
  * ext4 is faster for sequential directory traversal

- File Reads:
  * razorfs (FUSE3): 0.197s
  * ext4: 0.141s
  * ext4 is faster for sequential file reads

- Random Access:
  * razorfs (FUSE3): 0.0017s
  * ext4: 0.0736s
  * razorfs (FUSE3) is 43.3x faster for random access (significantly better cache locality!)

KEY FINDING:
RazorFS demonstrates significantly better performance for random access patterns,
indicating superior cache locality characteristics. This is attributed to:
1. 64-byte aligned nodes optimized for cache lines
2. 16-way branching reducing tree depth (O(log₁₆ n))
3. Contiguous memory layout
4. Spatial and temporal locality optimizations

The random access performance shows that RazorFS has excellent cache-friendly design,
which is critical for real-world workloads with unpredictable access patterns.
