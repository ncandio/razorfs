# Cache Locality Design and Optimization

## Overview

RAZORFS implements comprehensive cache-conscious design to maximize CPU cache efficiency at every level of the filesystem operations.

## Architecture

### Cache Line Alignment

All data structures are carefully aligned to cache line boundaries (64 bytes) to minimize cache misses and maximize throughput.

**Node Structure (64 bytes)**:
- Identity: 12 bytes (inode, parent_idx, num_children, mode)
- Naming: 4 bytes (name_offset in string table)
- Children: 32 bytes (16 × uint16_t indices, sorted for binary search)
- Metadata: 16 bytes (size, mtime, xattr_head)

**Multithreaded Node (128 bytes)**:
- Prevents false sharing between threads
- Each node on separate cache line boundary

### Memory Layout

**BFS (Breadth-First Search) Layout**:
- Siblings stored consecutively in memory
- Excellent spatial locality for directory operations
- Sequential access patterns enable hardware prefetching
- Periodic rebalancing maintains locality

### Performance Characteristics

**Measured Cache Hit Ratios**:
- Typical workload: ~70% cache hit ratio
- Peak performance: 92.5% cache hit ratio
- Sequential traversal benefits from BFS layout

## Implementation Details

### Cache-Friendly Operations

1. **Directory Traversal**: Siblings consecutive in memory
2. **Path Lookup**: Predictable access patterns
3. **Binary Search**: Children array fits in single cache line (32 bytes)

### Trade-offs

- **Rebalancing Cost**: Periodic BFS reorganization (every 100 operations)
- **Benefit**: Sustained cache locality over time
- **Result**: Net performance gain for read-heavy workloads

Thank you for your interest in contributing to RAZORFS! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Development Philosophy

RAZORFS embraces **AI-assisted engineering** with human oversight:

- **AI Tools**: Used for code generation, optimization, documentation, and testing
- **Human Role**: Architecture decisions, strategic direction, validation, and approval
- **Result**: Rapid prototyping with production-quality patterns through collaboration

We encourage exploring AI copilots (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, etc.) for development tasks while maintaining rigorous human review.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ncandio/razorfs.git
cd razorfs
```

### 2. Set Up Development Environment

**Prerequisites**:
- Linux (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, Debian 11+, or WSL2)
- GCC 11+ or Clang 14+
- FUSE3 development libraries
- zlib development libraries

**Install Dependencies**:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libfuse3-dev zlib1g-dev build-essential cmake
```

### 3. Build the Project

```bash
# Debug build (default)
make clean && make

# Release build (optimized)
make release

# Hardened build (security-optimized)
make hardened
```

### 4. Run Tests

**Always run tests before submitting**:

```bash
# Run full test suite
make test

# Run specific test categories
make test-unit          # Unit tests only
make test-integration   # Integration tests only
make test-static        # Static analysis
make test-valgrind      # Memory leak detection
make test-coverage      # Code coverage
```

**Required**: All 98 tests must pass ✅

### 5. Code Style Guidelines

**C Code Conventions**:
- Follow existing code style (K&R-style braces)
- Use meaningful variable names (no single-letter except loop counters)
- Add comments for complex algorithms
- Keep functions under 100 lines when possible
- Use `snake_case` for functions and variables

**Example**:
```c
// Good
int nary_find_child_mt(struct nary_node *parent, const char *name) {
    // Binary search for child in sorted array
    int left = 0, right = parent->num_children - 1;
    ...
}

// Avoid
int fc(struct nary_node *p, const char *n) { ... }  // Too cryptic
```

**Documentation**:
- Update README.md if adding user-facing features
- Add design docs to `docs/` for architectural changes
- Include inline comments for non-obvious code
- Update CHANGELOG.md with your changes

- `capture_benchmark_results.sh` (renamed to `capture_results.sh`)
- `cache_locality_plots.py`
- `create_simple_plot.sh`

**Docker Scripts** (→ `scripts/docker/`):
- `run_docker_cache_bench.sh`
- `docker-compose.yml`

### ✅ Data Files Organized

**Benchmark Results** (→ `benchmarks/results/`):
- `ext4_benchmark.csv`
- `razorfs_benchmark.csv`
- `razorfs_tree_depth.csv`

### ✅ Archived Files

**Obsolete/Duplicate Documents** (→ `.archive/`):
- `README_FULL.md` (superseded by README.md)
- `RESTRUCTURE_SUMMARY.md` (historical)
- `CACHE_LOCALITY_BENCH.md` (consolidated)
- `CACHE_LOCALITY_WORKFLOW_SUMMARY.md` (consolidated)
- `Cache.md` (consolidated)

### ✅ Consolidated Documentation

**Cache Documentation**:
- Combined 3 cache-related docs into single `docs/architecture/CACHE_LOCALITY.md`

### ✅ New Documentation Created

1. **`CHANGELOG.md`** - Version history and release notes
2. **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** - Contribution guidelines
3. **`docs/README.md`** - Documentation index and navigation
4. **`scripts/benchmarks/README.md`** - Benchmark usage guide

## Before & After

### Root Directory Cleanup

**Before** (23 files):
```
README.md, README_FULL.md, CACHE_LOCALITY_BENCH.md,
CACHE_LOCALITY_WORKFLOW_SUMMARY.md, Cache.md, CROSS_COMPILE.md,
GITHUB_ACTIONS_FIXES.md, RESTRUCTURE_SUMMARY.md, SECURITY.md,
TESTING_COVERAGE_REPORT.md, run_benchmark_suite.sh, run_cache_bench.sh,
capture_benchmark_results.sh, cache_locality_plots.py, create_simple_plot.sh,
run_docker_cache_bench.sh, docker-compose.yml, ext4_benchmark.csv,
razorfs_benchmark.csv, razorfs_tree_depth.csv, Makefile, LICENSE, etc.
```

**After** (8 essential files):
```
README.md, LICENSE, CHANGELOG.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, Makefile,
SECURITY.md, .gitignore, REORGANIZATION_REPORT.md
```

**Improvement**: 65% reduction in root directory clutter

### Documentation Structure

**Before**:
- Scattered across root and docs/
- No clear organization
- Duplicate files
- Mixed content types

**After**:
- Organized by category (architecture, features, development, operations, security, ci-cd)
- Clear navigation with docs/README.md
- Consolidated duplicates
- Logical grouping

## Benefits

### 1. **Improved Discoverability**
- Clear directory structure
- Documentation index (docs/README.md)
- Categorized content

### 2. **Reduced Clutter**
- Clean root directory (8 files vs 23)
- Scripts organized by purpose
- Data files in dedicated location

### 3. **Better Maintainability**
- Logical file organization
- Consolidated duplicates
- Historical files archived

### 4. **Enhanced Navigation**
- README files in each major directory
- Clear documentation hierarchy
- Quick reference guides

### 5. **Professional Structure**
- Follows open-source best practices
- CHANGELOG for version tracking
- CONTRIBUTING guide for new developers

## Next Steps

### Recommended Actions

1. **Review Changes**:
   ```bash
   git status
   git diff
   ```

2. **Test Build**:
   ```bash
   make clean && make
   make test
   ```

3. **Verify Scripts**:
   ```bash
   cd scripts/benchmarks
   ./run_benchmark_suite.sh
   ```

4. **Update Documentation**:
   - Review consolidated docs for accuracy
   - Update any broken internal links
   - Add version information

5. **Commit Changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "docs: Reorganize documentation structure for improved maintainability"
   ```

### Optional Enhancements

- [ ] Add `docs/architecture/PERSISTENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md` (combine 2 persistence docs)
- [ ] Add `docs/features/S3_INTEGRATION.md` (consolidate S3 docs)
- [ ] Add `docs/development/AI_METHODOLOGY.md` (document AI approach)
- [ ] Add `docs/operations/PERFORMANCE_TUNING.md`
- [ ] Create visual documentation map (diagram)

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to revert changes:

```bash
# Restore from backup
BACKUP_DIR="$(ls -td /home/nico/WORK_ROOT/razorfs_backup_* | head -1)"
echo "Restoring from: $BACKUP_DIR"
rm -rf /home/nico/WORK_ROOT/razorfs/*
cp -r $BACKUP_DIR/* /home/nico/WORK_ROOT/razorfs/
```
