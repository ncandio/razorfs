## 📋 Overview

RAZORFS is a FUSE3-based filesystem implementing an n-ary tree structure with advanced optimizations:

### Core Architecture
- **N-ary Tree:** 16-way branching factor with O(log₁₆ n) complexity
- **Inspiration:** Based on [ncandio/n-ary_python_package](https://github.com/ncandio/n-ary_python_package)
- **Implementation:** Pure C with FUSE3 interface

### Key Features

#### ✅ Performance Optimizations
- **O(log n) Complexity:** Logarithmic operations for lookup, insert, delete
- **Cache-Friendly:** 64-byte aligned nodes (single cache line)
- **NUMA-Aware:** Memory binding to CPU's NUMA node using mbind() syscall
- **Multithreaded:** ext4-style per-inode locking with deadlock prevention

#### ✅ Data Features
- **Transparent Compression:** zlib level 1 (automatic, lightweight)
  - Only files ≥ 512 bytes
  - Skips if no compression benefit
  - Magic header: 0x525A4350 ("RZCP")
- **Persistence:** Shared memory storage (/dev/shm)
  - Survives unmount/remount
  - mmap-based allocation
- **String Table:** Efficient filename storage with deduplication

#### ✅ FUSE3 Interface
- Standard file operations: create, read, write, delete, stat
- Directory operations: mkdir, readdir, rmdir
- Attribute support: getattr, chmod, chown
- POSIX compliance (partial)

## 📊 Performance Characteristics & Benchmarks

### Algorithmic Complexity
- **Lookup:** O(log₁₆ n) - 16-way branching reduces tree height
- **Insert:** O(log₁₆ n) - Balanced tree maintains logarithmic depth
- **Delete:** O(log₁₆ n) - Node removal with rebalancing
- **Memory:** 64-byte nodes, cache-line aligned

### Real-World Benchmark Results

#### O(log n) Scalability Validation
*Tested on live system - October 2025*

## 🔬 Technical Details

### N-ary Tree Design
- **Branching Factor:** 16 (optimized for cache lines)
- **Node Size:** 64 bytes (single cache line)
- **MT Node Size:** 128 bytes (includes pthread_rwlock_t)
- **Alignment:** Cache-line aligned to prevent false sharing

### Compression Strategy
- **Algorithm:** zlib compress2() level 1 (fastest)
- **Threshold:** 512 bytes minimum file size
- **Header:** 4-byte magic + 8-byte metadata
- **Skip Logic:** Only compress if compressed < original

### NUMA Support
- **Detection:** Automatic via /sys/devices/system/node/
- **Binding:** mbind() syscall with MPOL_BIND
- **Fallback:** Graceful degradation on single-node systems

### Locking Strategy (ext4-style)
- **Per-inode:** pthread_rwlock_t for each file/directory
- **Ordering:** Parent locked before child (deadlock prevention)
- **Granularity:** Fine-grained locks minimize contention

## ⚠️ Limitations & Known Issues

### Production Readiness: **NOT READY**
- ❌ No journaling/WAL (Write-Ahead Logging)
- ❌ No crash recovery (no journal replay)
- ❌ No xattr (extended attributes) support
- ❌ No hardlink support
- ❌ No mmap support
- ❌ Not optimized for large files (>10MB)
- ⚠️  Shared memory persistence (not crash-safe without journaling)

### What IS Implemented
- ✅ Basic POSIX: chmod, chown, truncate, rename
- ✅ Standard operations: create, read, write, mkdir, rmdir, unlink
- ✅ Multithreading with per-inode locks
- ✅ Transparent compression (zlib)
- ✅ Shared memory persistence (/dev/shm)
- ✅ O(log n) operations

### Recommended Use
- ✅ Research and education
- ✅ AI-assisted development experimentation
- ✅ Filesystem algorithm prototyping
- ✅ Performance benchmarking studies
- ✅ Small file workloads (<10MB per file)
- ❌ **NOT for production data storage**
- ❌ **NOT for critical data** (no crash recovery)

### Persistence Model Notes
**Current Implementation:**
- Tree nodes are stored in shared memory (`/dev/shm/razorfs_nodes`)
- String table (filenames) uses heap memory and is **not persisted**
- On remount, filenames are lost and replaced with placeholder names ("file")

**Limitation:** This is a known simplification for the prototype. True persistence requires:
1. String table in dedicated shared memory segment (`/razorfs_strings`)
2. Fixed-size string buffer (no `realloc()`)
3. String table metadata in shared memory header

**Impact:** Filenames are not preserved across unmount/remount cycles. The filesystem structure (tree) persists, but names are lost.
