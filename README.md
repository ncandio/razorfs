## üìä Graph Generation & Tagging System

All performance graphs in this README are automatically generated by the Docker-based testing infrastructure and include version tracking information to ensure reproducibility and traceability.

### Graph Tagging Convention

Each generated graph includes a tag in the format: `[DATE]-[COMMIT_SHA_SHORT]`

For example: `Generated: 2025-10-08 [a1b2c3d]`

### Tagging Process

1. **Date Stamp**: Automatically added with the format `YYYY-MM-DD`
2. **Commit SHA**: First 7 characters of the current Git commit SHA
3. **Generation Method**: Indicated as "Docker Infrastructure" or "Manual Generation"

### Graph Update Process

**When graphs should be updated:**
- After significant performance improvements or changes
- When running the Docker benchmark infrastructure (`./docker_test_infrastructure/generate_enhanced_graphs.sh`)
- When requested for new feature comparisons

**To update the tags:**
1. Run the benchmark infrastructure: `./docker_test_infrastructure/benchmark_filesystems.sh`
2. Or run enhanced generation: `./docker_test_infrastructure/generate_enhanced_graphs.sh`
3. The generated graphs include the date and commit SHA automatically
4. Copy the new graphs to `readme_graphs/` directory
5. Update this README section if needed to reflect current tag information

### Current Graph Tagging Status

| Graph File | Last Generated | Commit SHA | Generation Method |
|------------|----------------|------------|-------------------|
| comprehensive_performance_radar.png | 2025-10-08 | 84493cf | Docker Infrastructure |
| ologn_scaling_validation.png | 2025-10-08 | 84493cf | Docker Infrastructure |
| scalability_heatmap.png | 2025-10-08 | 84493cf | Docker Infrastructure |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations & Known Issues

### Production Readiness: **EXPERIMENTAL ALPHA**

**‚ö†Ô∏è ACTIVE PERSISTENCE DEVELOPMENT:**

RAZORFS has **excellent engineering** (data structures, multithreading, WAL/recovery code) and we are **actively addressing persistence and crash recovery challenges**:

**‚úÖ Current Progress:**
- Complete ARIES-style WAL implementation ([src/wal.h](src/wal.h))
- Full crash recovery code ([src/recovery.h](src/recovery.h))
- WAL is integrated into FUSE operations
- File-backed WAL at /tmp/razorfs_wal.log (survives crashes)
- **‚úÖ Recent testing confirms clean shutdown persistence works correctly**
- **‚úÖ Active work on persistent storage alternatives to /dev/shm**

**‚ùå Current Limitations (Under Active Development):**
- **Tree nodes in /dev/shm** - This is tmpfs (RAM-based), cleared on reboot
- **File content in /dev/shm** - All data lost on system reboot
- **String table in heap memory** - Not persisted across reboots
- We are actively developing disk-backed storage solutions

**What Currently Works:**
- ‚úÖ Survives process crashes (SIGKILL) with WAL recovery
- ‚úÖ Persists data across clean unmount/remount cycles
- ‚úÖ WAL replays metadata operations after crashes
- ‚úÖ Crash recovery functionality with Analysis/Redo/Undo phases
- ‚úÖ File content recovery after process crashes (when /dev/shm persists)

**What We're Actively Improving:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Implementing disk-backed storage (replacing /dev/shm with mmap'd files)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Persistent string table functionality
- ‚ö†Ô∏è True reboot persistence with ARIES-style recovery
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Enhanced crash simulation and recovery testing

**Implemented Features (Phase 6+):**
- ‚úÖ **WAL (Write-Ahead Logging)** - ARIES-style journaling, file-backed
- ‚úÖ **Crash Recovery** - Three-phase recovery: Analysis/Redo/Undo
- ‚úÖ **xattr Support** - Four namespaces with 64KB value support ([src/xattr.h](src/xattr.h))
- ‚úÖ **Hardlink Support** - Reference counting up to 65,535 links ([src/inode_table.h](src/inode_table.h))
- ‚úÖ **Multithreading** - ext4-style per-inode locking
- ‚úÖ **Compression** - Transparent zlib compression

**Remaining Features for Production:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Disk-backed storage** - Replacing /dev/shm with file-backed persistence (in development)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Persistent string table** - Complete filename persistence (in development)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Enhanced mmap support** - Optimized memory mapping (planned)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Large file support** - Optimized storage for files >10MB (planned)

### What IS Fully Implemented
- ‚úÖ Basic POSIX: chmod, chown, truncate, rename
- ‚úÖ Standard operations: create, read, write, mkdir, rmdir, unlink
- ‚úÖ Multithreading with per-inode locks
- ‚úÖ Transparent compression (zlib)
- ‚úÖ O(log n) operations
- ‚úÖ WAL journaling with crash recovery
- ‚úÖ Extended attributes (xattr)
- ‚úÖ Hardlink support with reference counting
- ‚úÖ Complete ARIES-style recovery system
- ‚úÖ Advanced testing infrastructure with crash simulation

### Recommended Use
- ‚úÖ Research and education
- ‚úÖ AI-assisted development experimentation
- ‚úÖ Filesystem algorithm prototyping
- ‚úÖ Performance benchmarking studies
- ‚úÖ **Temporary/scratch workloads** (data you can afford to lose)
- ‚úÖ **Testing crash recovery** functionality
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  **NOT for production use** (work in progress)
- ‚ùå **NOT for critical data** (while persistence is under development)

### Persistence Reality Check & Current Status

**Current Implementation:**
- Tree nodes: `/dev/shm/razorfs_nodes` (tmpfs - volatile RAM)
- File content: `/dev/shm/razorfs_data` (tmpfs - volatile RAM)
- String table: Heap memory (not persisted across reboots)
- WAL: `/tmp/razorfs_wal.log` (disk-backed - survives crashes with recovery)

**After System Reboot:** ALL data currently lost (tmpfs is cleared)
**After Process Crash (no reboot):** WAL replays operations successfully
**After Clean Shutdown/Remount:** Data persists (recent test verification confirms this)

**Current Development Focus:**
1. Replace /dev/shm with mmap'd files on real filesystem (ext4/xfs/btrfs)
2. Implement persistent string table functionality
3. Update node allocators to use file-backed mmap instead of shm_open
4. See [docs/PERSISTENCE_REALITY.md](docs/PERSISTENCE_REALITY.md) and [docs/DISK_BACKED_PERSISTENCE.md](docs/DISK_BACKED_PERSISTENCE.md) for detailed plans

**Recent Test Results** (October 2025):
*   **Clean Shutdowns:** The filesystem **successfully** persists data across clean unmount/remount cycles (confirmed by `test_advanced_persistence.sh`)
*   **Crash Scenarios:** The filesystem recovers after simulated crashes when data structures persist (ongoing optimization)
*   **Active Development:** We are systematically addressing each persistence challenge with engineering-focused solutions

**Our Approach:** Rather than dismissing concerns, we are methodically implementing robust solutions to make RAZORFS truly persistent and crash-safe.

## üìù DISCLAIMER: AI-Assisted Development Approach

RAZORFS was conceived from the decision to guide a project toward developing a filesystem with the appealing features and capabilities described in this README. These goals were designed to be attainable through AI-assisted development methodologies.

This project represents a hybrid approach where AI tools assist in rapid implementation while human oversight maintains critical design decisions and validation. The AI-assisted coding procedures employed in this project do not exclude other types of methodologies, nor do they diminish the deliberate act of human code design and architecture.

We explore the potential of AI-assisted engineering principles combined with human supervision for rapid development and prototyping. This approach allows for rapid iteration and experimentation with complex systems that would traditionally require significantly more time and resources. However, we remain agnostic about which techniques may be optimal for any given scenario, supporting both human-only and hybrid approaches based on project needs.

For those interested in understanding how AI tools work under the hood, this [Deep Dive into LLMs like ChatGPT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xTGNNLPyMI) provides an excellent explanation of what LLMs are, how they are built, and how they "guess" the correct or most reasonable answer depending on the corpus on which they are trained. The video also covers the resources they "know" or for which they are trained to respond, providing valuable context for understanding AI-assisted development.
