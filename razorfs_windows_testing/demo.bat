REM RAZOR Filesystem - Real Filesystem Testing Framework Demo
REM This script demonstrates the new testing capabilities

echo ==========================================
echo RAZOR FILESYSTEM - REAL FILESYSTEM TESTING
echo ==========================================
echo.
echo This update adds comprehensive testing against REAL implementations of
echo traditional filesystems, not just simulations.
echo.
echo NEW TESTING CAPABILITIES:
echo =======================
echo.
echo 1. REAL FILESYSTEM COMPARISON:
echo    - Tests RAZOR against actual EXT4, BTRFS, ReiserFS, XFS, and SquashFS
echo    - Measures REAL read/write speeds (not simulated)
echo    - Evaluates ACTUAL compression efficiency
echo    - Provides accurate performance metrics
echo.
echo 2. CRASH RECOVERY TESTING:
echo    - Simulates unclean unmount scenarios
echo    - Tests data integrity after forced shutdowns
echo    - Measures recovery success rates
echo    - Evaluates filesystem resilience
echo.
echo 3. COMPREHENSIVE GRAPH GENERATION:
echo    - Clear visualizations with legends
echo    - Key outcomes highlighted
echo    - Executive dashboard with recommendations
echo.
echo NEW COMMANDS AVAILABLE:
echo =====================
echo.
echo To use these new capabilities, run:
echo.
echo   stress-test.bat real-filesystem    - Run real filesystem comparison
echo   stress-test.bat crash-recovery     - Run crash recovery test
echo   stress-test.bat combined           - Run complete test suite
echo.
echo   stress-test.bat full-real          - Real filesystem test with graphs
echo   stress-test.bat full-crash         - Crash recovery test with graphs
echo   stress-test.bat full-combined      - Complete test suite with graphs
echo.
echo KEY BENEFITS:
echo ============
echo.
echo - Compare RAZOR against REAL filesystem implementations
echo - Measure actual performance, not simulations
echo - Test crash recovery with real data integrity verification
echo - Generate professional charts with clear legends
echo - Get actionable insights with executive dashboard
echo.
echo RESULTS INCLUDE:
echo ===============
echo.
echo - Performance metrics (read/write speeds in MB/s)
echo - Compression efficiency (space savings percentage)
echo - Crash recovery success rates
echo - Comprehensive visualization charts
echo - Executive summary with recommendations
echo.
echo These enhancements provide a much more accurate and comprehensive
echo evaluation of RAZOR filesystem compared to traditional implementations.
