CACHE LOCALITY ANALYSIS REPORT
============================

FILESYSTEMS COMPARED:
- RazorFS (FUSE3-based N-ary Tree Filesystem)
- ext4 (Standard Linux filesystem)

BENCHMARK OPERATIONS:
- Directory Traversal: Sequential access to directories
- File Reads: Sequential access to file contents
- Random Access: Random access to files

ARCHITECTURAL ADVANTAGES OF RAZORFS:
- 64-byte aligned nodes for cache line optimization
- 16-way branching for O(log₁₆ n) complexity
- Contiguous memory layout for tree nodes
- NUMA-aware memory allocation
- Spatial and temporal locality optimizations

PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:
- dir_traversal: ext4 is 1.23x faster than razorfs (FUSE3)
- read: ext4 is 1.39x faster than razorfs (FUSE3)
- random_access: razorfs (FUSE3) is 43.30x faster than ext4


CONCLUSION:
The filesystem with lower access times demonstrates better cache locality.
Cache locality is important because it:
1. Reduces CPU cache misses
2. Improves spatial locality (data accessed together is stored together)
3. Improves temporal locality (frequently accessed data stays in cache)
4. Reduces memory access latency

NOTES:
- Results may vary based on system configuration
- Cache-friendly filesystems show greater benefits with larger datasets
- RazorFS uses FUSE3 for mounting, which adds userspace overhead but provides flexibility
